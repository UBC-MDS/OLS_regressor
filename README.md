# OLS_Regressor

OLS Regressor

## About
The OLS Regression Package is a Python library designed to streamline the process of performing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or analyst, this package aims to provide a simple and efficient tool for fitting linear models to your data. It will fit a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, w2, ..., wn) to minimize Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) between the observed targets values in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation for the examples in the dataset.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install ols_regressor
```

## Functions

- `fit`: Fits the linear model according to the OLS mechanism.
- `predict`: Predicts target values using the fitted linear model.
- `score`: Calculates the coefficient of determination R-squared value for the prediction.
